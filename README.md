# Project Overview

e campus aims to provide a cashless transactions ecosystem for an organization, which in our case is university, by providing a blockchain based payment solution that benefits faculty, staff and students alike. We aim to make the campus cashless and hustle free.

Using our system any transaction in the university at any level will be done without cash, simply by using our developed app. The app will allow to proceed for different transactions between any two entities of the system. In the blockchain based private network, each entity of the organization will have defined roles. The system will make the transactions fast, traceable and will provide a maintenance free self-driven system. The system will also reduce the financial resources as there is no need to install more atm machines even if the number of students are increased every year. Also, the system will encourage everyone to donate for the community cause.

# Motivation

To carry on with the future we were motivated to develop a self-driven cashless system for the payments with no maintenance cost which will effectively reduce the financial cost of the organization. e-Campus will provide a trustless system and will encourage its stakeholders to contribute for the community cause. Thatâ€™s why we came up with the idea of e-campus.
